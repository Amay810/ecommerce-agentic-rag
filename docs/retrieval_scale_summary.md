# Retrieval scale and ablation

## NSCC FAISS scale result

The same 250-query scale set is evaluated while distractors grow from 40 to
5,000 products. It contains 200 programmatic attribute cases and 50 generated
hard candidates; the latter are not human-labelled yet.

| Products | Chunks | Recall@1 | Recall@5 | MRR | nDCG@5 | P50 | P95 | Index |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 40 | 365 | 0.9583 | 1.0000 | 0.9868 | 0.9901 | 9.44ms | 9.96ms | 1.58MB |
| 1,000 | 8,770 | 0.9625 | 0.9958 | 0.9878 | 0.9888 | 20.52ms | 28.93ms | 37.30MB |
| 5,000 | 43,953 | 0.9542 | 0.9917 | 0.9798 | 0.9826 | 79.59ms | 125.73ms | 185.52MB |

FAISS IndexFlatIP is the reported NSCC dense backend. Build time was not
captured in the first run; `nscc/measure_index_builds.pbs` now records model
load, embedding, persistence and total build time separately.

## 5k reranker decision

| Configuration | Recall@1 | Recall@5 | nDCG@5 | P95 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Hybrid + constraints | 0.9542 | 0.9917 | 0.9826 | 108.37ms |
| + BGE reranker | 0.9750 | 0.9958 | 0.9958 | 219.12ms |

The reranker improves top-rank quality but only adds 0.0041 Recall@5 while
roughly doubling P95. It remains off by default and is suitable for conditional
use on high-value comparison or multi-constraint requests.

## Hard-set boundary

The title-debiased v2 locked set reaches only Recall@5=0.8029. A dense threshold
raises no-answer accuracy to 0.75 but reduces Recall@5 to 0.4964. The fresh v3
holdout reaches Recall@5=0.6889, with typo and attribute-only queries as the main
failures. These results are reported separately from the easier scale set.
